= pms - Poor Man's Search

== VERSION

This documentation refers to pms version 0.0.2


== DESCRIPTION

Provides a simple searching facility for (nearly) arbitrary input. It allows
searching by Strings (exact match) or Regexps (full control, but slower).
Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT are supported, as well as proximity
operators NEAR (with configurable distance) and ADJACENT (taking order into
account). You can chain operators and also group them into sub-queries.

Inspiration came from a discussion on ruby-talk, starting with message
ruby-talk:322014[http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/322014],
but PMS has a more document-centric attitude (everything that <tt>input#each</tt>
yields is considered a document of its own).

Example:

  require 'pms/ext'

  text = <<EOT
  Hello world, how are you today? I said "Hello"
  to the other guy but he would not answer although
  all the world could hear me.
  EOT

  search = text.search('hello').near('world', 3)

  p search.results
  #=> [0]

  p search.results_with_positions
  #=> {0=>[0, 8]}

  p search.matches
  #=> ["Hello world, how are you today? I said \"Hello\"\n"]

You can find more examples in the <tt>spec/</tt> directory.
